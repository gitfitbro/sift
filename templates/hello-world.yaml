  A minimal starter template to learn sift. Two simple phases with text capture -
  no audio or API key needed for the demo.

phases:
  - id: describe
    name: Describe Something
    prompt: >
      Describe anything - a project idea, a problem you are solving,
      or what you had for breakfast. This is just to see how sift works.
    capture:
      - type: text
        required: true
    extract:
      - id: key_points
        type: list
        prompt: List the main points or ideas mentioned
      - id: summary
        type: text
        prompt: Write a one-sentence summary

  - id: reflect
    name: Reflect and Add
    prompt: >
      Look at what was captured in the previous phase. Is there anything
      you would add or change?
    depends_on: describe
    capture:
      - type: text
        required: false
    extract:
      - id: additions
        type: list
        prompt: List any additions or corrections
      - id: overall_impression
        type: text
        prompt: What is the overall takeaway?

outputs:
  - type: yaml
    template: session-config
  - type: markdown
    template: session-summary
